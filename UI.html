   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>Hello! I'm Atharva Mahabal, a passionate software developer with 2 years of hands-on experience in creating innovative solutions. I've always been fascinated by technology and the incredible possibilities it offers, and I'm thrilled to be a part of this dynamic field.</p>

   <p>My journey in software development began when I completed my Masters degree in Computer Application from IMCC College Pune University. Since then, I've had the privilege of working with some exceptional teams and contributing to a variety of exciting projects.</p>

   <p>In my work, I specialize in a range of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java.In low code platforms I have worked on Thingworx and Contineo, I'm well-versed in popular frameworks like React and Node.js, and I have experience in developing web applications, APIs.</p>

   <p>During my tenure in the industry, I've had the opportunity to work with companies like Indicus and Trimasys Control Solutions. Notable achievements include giving a presentation at IIT Bombay on Thingworx platform.</p>

   <p>What truly fuels my passion for software development is the belief that it has the power to transform lives and solve real-world problems. I'm a firm believer in the importance of continuous learning, and I'm committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.</p>

   <p>Collaboration and teamwork are at the core of my work philosophy. I enjoy collaborating with talented designers, product managers, and fellow developers to bring creative ideas to life. It's incredible to witness how diverse perspectives can lead to groundbreaking solutions.</p>

   <p>Outside of work, I'm an enthusiastic maker and tinkerer. I enjoy building side projects, experimenting with emerging technologies, and participating in hackathons. I also have a love for photography, which allows me to capture and appreciate the beauty in everyday life.</p>
